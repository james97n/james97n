I build **scalable full stack applications**, obsess over **developer experience**, and love making UIs that don’t just work — they *feel* good.

When I’m not squashing bugs or reading through yet another RFC, I’m probably:
- 🎧 Jamming out on guitar (badly)
- 🛫 Planning my next country to explore
- 🤓 Researching AI things
